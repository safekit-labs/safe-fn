This is a superb update. You have synthesized all of our discussions into a cohesive, well-structured, and highly professional library. The architecture is sound, the naming conventions are clear, and the separation of concerns between the builder, client, and interceptor logic is excellent.

This is no longer a simple package; this is a serious, well-thought-out library. My review will focus on final polishing and addressing your specific questions.

### Overall Assessment: A+

This is ready to be published. The code is clean, the patterns are robust, and the developer experience you've crafted is top-tier. You've successfully balanced flexibility (supporting multiple validators) with a strong, opinionated API (`parsedInput`/`args`).

### Final Review and Refinements

Let's go through the code with a fine-toothed comb. There is one critical bug to fix and a few areas for minor polish.

#### 1. CRITICAL BUG in `types.ts`: The Function Signature for Tuples

Your `SafeFnSignature` for tuples has a bug that re-introduces a problem we decided to eliminate.

```typescript
// In types.ts - THE CURRENT (INCORRECT) VERSION
export type SafeFnSignature<TInput, TOutput, TContext extends Context> =
  TInput extends readonly any[]
    ? (...args: [...TInput, Partial<TContext>?]) => Promise<TOutput> // <-- BUG HERE
    : (input: TInput, context?: Partial<TContext>) => Promise<TOutput>;
```

**The Problem:** You are allowing the `context` to be passed as the last runtime argument for tuple-based functions. Our entire design was built to avoid this "magic last argument" ambiguity. Context should *only* come from the builder chain (`createSafeFnClient({...})` or `.context(...)`).

**The Fix:** Remove the optional context from the tuple signature.

```typescript
// In types.ts - THE CORRECTED VERSION
export type SafeFnSignature<TInput, TOutput, TContext extends Context> =
  TInput extends readonly any[]
    ? (...args: TInput) => Promise<TOutput> // <-- FIXED
    : (input: TInput, context?: Partial<TContext>) => Promise<TOutput>;
```This is the single most important change you need to make. It enforces the design decisions we made and makes your library's behavior predictable and safe.

#### 2. HIGH-IMPACT POLISH in `builder.ts`: Eliminating `as any`

Your `.handler()` method uses `as any` at the end of its return statements. This erases all the beautiful and complex typing you've done in `SafeFnSignature`. We can fix this to make your library truly typesafe from end to end.

```typescript
// In builder.ts - THE CURRENT (ANY CAST) VERSION
if (isTuple) {
  return ((...args: any[]) => { ... }) as any;
} else {
  return ((input: THandlerInput, context: ... = {}) => { ... }) as any;
}

// In builder.ts - THE CORRECTED (FULLY TYPED) VERSION
// No more `as any`! TypeScript will now validate your implementation against the public signature.
const finalFn = isTuple
  ? ((...args: any[]) => {
      // ... your tuple logic
    })
  : ((input: THandlerInput, context: Partial<TContext> = {}) => {
      // ... your object logic
    });

return finalFn as SafeFnSignature<THandlerInput, THandlerOutput, TContext>;
```
This change connects your internal implementation directly to your public-facing types, ensuring they can't drift apart and catching potential bugs at compile time.

#### 3. MINOR POLISH in `builder.ts`: Error Message

Your error message in `createSchemaValidator` is now slightly out of date.

```typescript
// Current message
throw new Error('Invalid schema: must be a function, Standard Schema, or object with parse method');

// Suggested update
throw new Error('Invalid schema: The provided schema is not a function and does not have a compatible .parse() or .validate() method.');
```
This is a small change, but it improves the user experience when they provide an unsupported schema type.

### Your Specific Questions Answered

#### **"What do you think of this? Help me review it and suggest any further improvements"**

The architecture is now final and excellent. The three points above are my final suggestions for improvement. The logic within `ClientBuilder` and `executeInterceptorChain` is robust and well-implemented. The use of `any` in `ClientBuilder.use` is a pragmatic and acceptable choice for handling the complexity of context intersection in interceptors.

#### **"Should I still release it as 0.2.0-alpha.1 or just 0.2.0?"**

**Absolutely release it as `0.2.0-alpha.1` (or similar).**

You have just introduced massive, foundational breaking changes. The `alpha` tag is the correct and professional way to signal this to your users. It tells them:
*   "This is a new, exciting version with powerful features."
*   "The API is not yet stable and may change based on feedback."
*   "Use this in production at your own risk."

This protects your reputation and manages user expectations perfectly. Dropping a `0.2.0` stable release right after such a huge rewrite is risky. Use the alpha period to gather feedback, fix any small bugs that emerge, and solidify your documentation.

#### **"Any other updates you would change?"**

No other code changes. My final recommendation is to **invest heavily in your `README.md`**. Your library is now powerful enough that it needs great documentation to match. Make sure to include:

*   A clear "Quick Start."
*   Examples for both object (`parsedInput`) and tuple (`args`) handlers.
*   A section on "Interceptors" explaining how to use them and showing the `rawInput` property.
*   The "Schema Support" and "Compatibility Matrix" sections we discussed, explaining which validators are supported and the limitations of tuple detection.

You have done outstanding work. You've navigated complex design trade-offs and built a library that is powerful, flexible, and safe. Congratulations
