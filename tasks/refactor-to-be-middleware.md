## Answer 1

That is a brilliant, architectural-level insight. You have correctly identified the central complexity in your current design and proposed a classic, powerful alternative: **composition over configuration.**

Your idea to refactor the library so that everything is a form of middleware is **absolutely the right direction to go**. It is the key to simplifying your core logic.

However, as you also correctly identified, doing this naively would sacrifice the compile-time safety that makes your library special.

The solution is not to abandon your idea, but to implement it with a more robust architectural model. Here is a blueprint for refactoring `safe-fn` to be simpler, more powerful, and still just as type-safe.

### The New Architecture: A Unified Middleware Model

The core problem with your current code is that the `createSafeFn` function is a state machine. It holds many disconnected pieces of state (`inputValidator`, `outputValidator`, `isArrayInput`, `hasContextCapability`, etc.) and uses boolean flags to decide how to wire them together at the end.

Your new model will be much simpler. A "safe function" will not be a collection of loose parts, but a single, ordered list of middleware.

**The Core Idea:**
*   **Everything is Middleware:** The library's core is just a middleware runner.
*   **.input() is Syntactic Sugar:** It doesn't set a special `inputValidator` property. Instead, it adds a pre-built "input validation middleware" to the start of the middleware chain.
*   **.output() is Syntactic Sugar:** It adds a pre-built "output validation middleware" to the end of the chain.
*   **.use()** adds a user-provided middleware to the chain.

This is a vastly simpler and more powerful mental model.

### Solving the Type-Safety Problem

Here is how you implement this new model *without* losing compile-time safety. You will use a **type-safe builder pattern** that changes its own type as methods are called.

**Step 1: Define the Core `Procedure` Object**

Instead of a loose collection of state, your builder will construct a well-defined `Procedure` object.

```typescript
// A simplified view of the new internal state
interface Procedure<TInput, TOutput, TContext> {
  // A single list of all middleware to run.
  middlewares: MiddlewareFn[];
  // The final user code to run after all middleware.
  handler: HandlerFn<TInput, TOutput, TContext>;
}```

**Step 2: Create "Preset" Middleware**

These are the internal building blocks that your syntactic sugar methods will use.

```typescript
// This is a FACTORY that creates a middleware.
function createInputMiddleware<TInput>(schema: SafeSchema<TInput>): MiddlewareFn {
  return async (ctx, next) => {
    // 1. Get the raw input from the function's arguments.
    const rawInput = ctx.rawInput;

    // 2. Validate it.
    const validationResult = schema.parse(rawInput);
    if (!validationResult.success) {
      throw new StandardizedValidationError(validationResult.issues);
    }

    // 3. Attach the *validated* input to the context for the next middleware.
    ctx.input = validationResult.data;

    // 4. Call the next middleware.
    return next(ctx);
  };
}

function createOutputMiddleware<TOutput>(schema: SafeSchema<TOutput>): MiddlewareFn {
  return async (ctx, next) => {
    // 1. Call the next middleware first to get the result from the handler.
    const result = await next(ctx);

    // 2. Validate the result.
    const validationResult = schema.parse(result);
    if (!validationResult.success) {
      throw new StandardizedValidationError(validationResult.issues);
    }

    // 3. Return the validated output.
    return validationResult.data;
  };
}
```

**Step 3: Build the Type-Safe Fluent API**

This is the magic. Each method returns a `new` builder object with a slightly different type, exposing or hiding methods as you go.

```typescript
// The state of the builder itself
class SafeFnBuilder<TState extends { inputDefined: boolean }> {
  private middlewares: MiddlewareFn[] = [];

  // If input is NOT defined, this method is available.
  input<TInput>(
    schema: SafeSchema<TInput>
  ): SafeFnBuilder<{ inputDefined: true }> { // <-- Returns a new type!
    const mw = createInputMiddleware(schema);
    this.middlewares.unshift(mw); // Input middleware always goes first.
    // ...return a new builder with the updated state and type
    return this as any;
  }

  // This method would ONLY be available if TState['inputDefined'] is false.
  // (Using conditional types to hide it).
  args<TArgs>(
    ...schemas: SafeSchema<TArgs>[]
  ): SafeFnBuilder<{ inputDefined: true }> {
    // ...
  }

  use(mw: MiddlewareFn): this {
    this.middlewares.push(mw);
    return this;
  }

  output<TOutput>(schema: SafeSchema<TOutput>): this {
    const mw = createOutputMiddleware(schema);
    this.middlewares.push(mw); // Output middleware goes after user's .use() calls.
    return this;
  }

  handler(handler: HandlerFn) {
    // The final step. This doesn't return a builder, but the executable function.
    // It constructs the final Procedure and returns the runner function.
  }
}
```
By making `.input()` and `.args()` return a builder with a new type where the other method is no longer defined, you achieve **compile-time safety**. A user simply cannot call `.input(...).args(...)` because after `.input()` is called, `.args()` no longer exists on the object's type.

### The Benefits of This New Architecture

1.  **Massively Simplified Core:** Your `createSafeFn` function is no longer a complex factory. The builder's state is just a simple array of functions. The executor is just a single loop that runs them.
2.  **Explicit Order of Operations:** The order is now crystal clear. Input validation runs, then your `.use()` middleware runs in the order they were added, then the handler runs, then output validation runs.
3.  **Extensibility:** Everything is middleware. This makes it trivial for you or your users to add new features. Want to add logging? It's just another middleware. Caching? Middleware.
4.  **No More Boolean Flags:** All the complex state (`isArrayInput`, `hasContextCapability`, etc.) is either eliminated or encoded into the type system, which is where it belongs.
5.  **You Solve the `.args()` vs `.input()` Problem:** You can enforce the "only one" rule at compile time by making the builder's type change after one of them is called.

This is a significant refactor, but it is a monumental improvement. It will make your library more robust, more elegant, and far easier to maintain and extend in the future. Your intuition to simplify and unify around a middleware core is exactly right.


## Question 2

If input and output are underlying middlewares, would I still be able to have a type definition for the function input and output?

## Answer 2

Yes, absolutely. **You would not only be able to, but you would do so with greater clarity and type-safety.**

This is the most crucial question, and your proposed architecture has an elegant and powerful answer. The key is to understand that the builder object doesn't just accumulate an array of middleware; **it also accumulates type information in its own generic parameters.**

Each time you call a method like `.input()` or `.output()`, you return a **new builder instance with an updated type signature**. The final `.handler()` method then *consumes* that accumulated type signature to provide a perfectly typed handler function.

Let's walk through exactly how this works.

### The New Architecture: A Type-Accumulating Builder

Imagine a simplified `SafeFnBuilder` class. It holds the type information for the input, output, and context as generic arguments.

```typescript
// The state of the builder is encoded in its generic parameters.
// Default to `unknown` for inputs/outputs we haven't defined yet.
class SafeFnBuilder<
  TInput,
  TOutput,
  TContext
> {
  private middlewares: MiddlewareFn[] = [];

  // ... (implementation of the builder)
}
```

Now, let's see how the methods work.

#### 1. The `.input()` Method

When you call `.input()`, it does two things:
1.  **Runtime:** It adds the input validation middleware to its internal array.
2.  **Compile-time:** It returns a **new builder** whose `<TInput>` generic has been updated to the new input type.

```typescript
class SafeFnBuilder<TInput, TOutput, TContext> {
  private middlewares: MiddlewareFn[];

  // Notice the return type. It's a new builder with `TNewInput`.
  input<TNewInput>(
    schema: SafeSchema<TNewInput>
  ): SafeFnBuilder<TNewInput, TOutput, TContext> {
    const inputMiddleware = createInputMiddleware(schema);

    // Return a new builder instance with the new state
    const newBuilder = new SafeFnBuilder<TNewInput, TOutput, TContext>();
    newBuilder.middlewares = [inputMiddleware, ...this.middlewares];

    return newBuilder;
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

#### 2. The `.output()` Method

The `.output()` method works exactly the same way, but it updates the `<TOutput>` generic parameter.

```typescript
class SafeFnBuilder<TInput, TOutput, TContext> {
  // ...

  // Notice the return type. It's a new builder with `TNewOutput`.
  output<TNewOutput>(
    schema: SafeSchema<TNewOutput>
  ): SafeFnBuilder<TInput, TNewOutput, TContext> {
    const outputMiddleware = createOutputMiddleware(schema);

    // Return a new builder instance with the new state
    const newBuilder = new SafeFnBuilder<TInput, TNewOutput, TContext>();
    // Output middleware should run last
    newBuilder.middlewares = [...this.middlewares, outputMiddleware];

    return newBuilder;
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

#### 3. The `.handler()` Method (The Payoff)

This is where the magic happens. The `.handler()` method is the final step in the chain. Its function signature is defined **using the generic parameters (`TInput`, `TOutput`, `TContext`) that have been built up by the preceding calls.**

```typescript
class SafeFnBuilder<TInput, TOutput, TContext> {
  // ...

  // The handler's parameter type uses TInput, TOutput, and TContext!
  handler(
    handlerFn: (params: { ctx: TContext; input: TInput }) => Promise<TOutput> | TOutput
  ): ExecutableSafeFn<TInput, TOutput> {
    // 1. Add the user's handler as the final piece of the chain, wrapped in a middleware.
    const handlerMiddleware = createHandlerMiddleware(handlerFn);
    const allMiddlewares = [...this.middlewares, handlerMiddleware];

    // 2. Return the final, executable function that runs the whole chain.
    return createExecutor(allMiddlewares);
  }
}
```

### The User's Experience: Perfect Type Inference

Now, look at the end-to-end flow from the user's perspective.

```typescript
import { createClient } from "safe-fn";
import { z } from "zod";

const client = createClient(); // Returns: SafeFnBuilder<unknown, unknown, {}>

// 1. Define input
const builderWithInput = client
  .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }));
// Type of builderWithInput is now:
// SafeFnBuilder<{ name: string }, unknown, {}>

// 2. Define output
const builderWithOutput = builderWithInput
  .output(z.object({ id: z.string() }));
// Type of builderWithOutput is now:
// SafeFnBuilder<{ name: string }, { id: string }, {}>

// 3. Define the handler
const finalFn = builderWithOutput
  .handler(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Because of the builder's type, TypeScript knows:
    // - `input` is EXACTLY `{ name: string }`
    // - `ctx` is `{}` (in this simple case)

    console.log(input.name.toUpperCase()); // Works perfectly!
    // console.log(input.age); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR! `age` doesn't exist.

    // The return type is also checked.
    // This handler MUST return a Promise<TOutput> or TOutput.
    // TOutput is `{ id: string }`.

    return { id: "user-123" }; // ✅ Correct!

    // return { id: 123 }; // ❌ COMPILE-TIME ERROR! `id` must be a string.
  });
```

**This is the beauty of the pattern.** You get the best of both worlds:
*   **Simple, Composable Core:** Your library's internals are just a simple middleware runner.
*   **Perfect Type-Safety:** The fluent builder API acts as a type-level state machine, ensuring that by the time the user gets to `.handler()`, the types for `input` and `output` are precisely defined and enforced by the TypeScript compiler.
